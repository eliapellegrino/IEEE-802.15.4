# IEEE 802.15.4
This repository contains two different version of transmitter and receiver boards implementing IEEE 802.15.4 standards.
Up to now (v1.0), only basic features are implemented: for example CCA alghoritm is not implemented!

## RECEIVER / RECEVEIVER FLASH
The only difference is that in **FLASH** version, the received packet is not written on serial port, but in flash memory!

## TRANSMITTER / TRANSMITTER FLASH
The only difference is that in **FLASH** version, the transmitted packet is not written on serial port, but in flash memory!
